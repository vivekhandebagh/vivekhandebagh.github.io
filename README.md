Hi, my name is Vivek Handebagh. I am an undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Physics and Minor in Neuroscience @ the University of California, Davis.
My current research interests include Complex Systems, AI, and Theoretical Neuroscience. This page will serve as a place for my thoughts, learnings, and projects.

![Here's what I look like](https://github.com/vivekhandebagh/vivekhandebagh.github.io/assets/54450878/e2c2508d-1121-4188-963c-adb429957083)


Here is a list of personal questions on Consciousness, AI, and Neuroscience? Some of these questions have a real scope in being answered sooner than later with the rapid technological developments, while other questions are simple whimsical.

+ What is the nature of intelligence?

+ What is a framework that we can use to dissect and understand different aspects of the mind?

+ What aspects of the mind and intelligence are emergent structures of a sufficient network of neurons, and what aspects aren’t?

+ Consequently, what is AI really, and what properties of the mind can we ascribe it?

+ If computation and universal function approximators emerge because of a network of nodes, and we define the node not just as the specialized neuron, but also include any organic cell that is interacting with another cell in some ways, how do our views on what organisms really are, life, sentience, consciousness, intelligence, and the interconnectedness of nature change?

+ How do you explore the concept of the biological internet? How is biological/organoid computing different from conventional silicon-based computing?

+ Current neuroscience describes how this neural network that we call the brain and body is constantly taking in sensory input data from the external world and the biological input data from the internal world, is creating/updating a model or representation of both worlds, and then projects it back out for “us” to experience. The model is what we give names to. This model here is known as “Vivek.” However, the observer that experiences the projection is what we define as consciousness or the true self. 

+ In essence, what is reality? What are we doing when we try to understand it? What is the philosophy of measurement?

+ How do we know that our model is accurate? Or is this question simply futile as we don’t have any other choice?

+ When two people are interacting, let’s assume intimately, essentially, two networks of cells come really close together. What are the possibilities of information transfer between these two networks? Over time, how can these networks become coupled? Can there be states of resonance between two sufficiently distinct networks that can explain the nature of love?

+ What would happen if we were able to create a scalable interface between biological computing and silicon computing?

+ What is aesthetics?

+ Is aesthetics exclusive to the human condition? Also do other species on the planet have a sense of aesthetics?

+ What formal relationships can be drawn between ethics and game theory? What is the ideal game that AI should be playing and how can that help define the morality of an AI model?

+ What aspect of us dies? Can AI die?

+ In addiction, the brain has become hardwired to perform some behavior. However, there are times when the individual, mainly in the process of trying to break that addiction, can challenge and resist the strongly desired output of their model. How does this work? What is happening when someone makes a decision that is unusual to the default, contradicts what their brain tells them to do?

+ Can the degree of conscious awareness be quantified? Is this variable continuous or discrete? How do we relate the values of this variable to the common subjective experience?

+ What is it to dream? What is it to experience a lucid dream?
