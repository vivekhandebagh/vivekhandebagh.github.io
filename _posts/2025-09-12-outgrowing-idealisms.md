Human nature is downstream of the material conditions that surround it. 

Im not a commie nor are I too well read on marxist literature, but I'm going to have to give one to them here.

It’s quite interesting, actually both Chanakya and Marx share this sense of historical materialism. The Arthashastra goes into some detail about how economics/statecraft is the apex of all knowledge and how all moral, spiritual, and metaphysical knowledge is downstream of it. This sentiment is pretty much encapsulated by his famous quote: “dharmasya mūlam arthah” (material prosperity is the root of all righteousness/cosmic order).

I am reminded of this in part by the recent events of political violence, but largely this has already been a latent thought in my mind. I actually think power dynamics, political struggles, and violence is by nature a never ending loop. Theorists like Polybius have been describing anacyclosis: the cycle of monarchy decaying into tyranny, then aristocracy to oligarchy, democracy to mob rule, and back. And this dynamic is reflected in history at various scales.

That said, if there is any axis in the world along which change has been monotonic rather than cyclical, it is technology and the material abundance that emerges as a function of it. We literally went from sticks and stones to building quantum chips, and through all of that and before, humans have been fighting endless turf-wars.

This is fundamentally because social games and power grabs are zero-sum—someone wins only if someone else loses. Technology and wealth creation, on the other hand, are positive-sum; they expand the pie for everyone. And as material abundance grew, so too did the standards by which we judge ourselves and others. 

For the first time in the history of the world, your moral rating within the local socio-intellectual circle is conditioned on making strong statements about injustices and complex situations thousands of miles away from you.

I don’t think our psychology has evolved fast enough to process suffering at this scope. And as a result, you see the emergence of two polar archetypes: the Instagram activists with a range of mental health issues and the matcha drinking NPCs strolling in a blissful ignorance. 

Its actually not quite easy to strike the balance here. A constant tug-of-war between pragmatism and emotional sensitivity. 

At any given moment of time, there are an inconceivably large number of sufferings, conflicts, political issues, or social injustices. Which one to choose? Which sorting algorithm will tell me whose pain matters the most? If I say they are all uniformly distributed by importance, how do I take a step forward?

Like this wasn’t a problem for any of our ancestors. It was quite simple. If the problem affects any subset of {me, my fam, my tribe}, then attend to it, and this solution is embedded in our neural systems.

But now, the problems that matter to us are not necessarily because we have any sort of personal connection to them, but because a particular narrative has won the mimetic battle. The flavor of your political tantrum is modulated by recommendation_watchnext.serve(). 

I guess, this all just feels brittle to me.

Maybe this is that maturity in me developing, where I’m slightly less attracted to idealisms, and especially less so in terms of political debates. As Marx and Chanakya would say, "Like no, just fix the economy first."
