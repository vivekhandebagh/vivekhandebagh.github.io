> The moon was pretty tonight.  
> Yet, I still felt so conflicted.  
> I want to understand the beautiful.  
> But on the other hand, I want to feel the beautiful.  
> The search for intellectual clarity probably prevents it.  
> Perhaps, feeling is maximal knowledge.  
> I really don't know anymore.
> What do we do if the truth is ugly but we know we are meant for bliss?  
> Sleep feels blissful.  
> Non‑existence kind of feels good right now.  
> Am I sad?  
> I don't think so, but do you ever just feel like laying down on the concrete?  
> Perhaps I am tired of being the only one to witness myself.  
> It's that same, stupid, simple feeling—  
> You know when you keep driving and driving, 
> and the AC stops working and you end up melting into the seat.
> It no longer feels like there is a passenger on this journey.
> What does a Waymo think about when it's all alone?
> I think my desire to understand is really a desire to be understood.  
> Please, I don't want to sleep tonight.  
> My insides are churning.  
> Not sure if it is the Taco Bell or the existential dread.  
> I guess depth is what we are all looking for.  
> Isn't that why we keep setting goals?    
> Why does my heart want to sink?  
> Perhaps it is tired of people telling it what it should be doing.  
> Heard too many definitions of love.  
> How can something so haphazardly over‑defined actually mean anything tangible at all?  
> A distant and fading memory at this point.   
> You know, I do try to remember things.  
> But I don't think I ate enough okra when love was still real.  
> My tears are stuck behind my skull.  
> I ask it to come out and play, but it seems like my knocks aren't getting through.  
> If only I had a Ring camera for my consciousness.  
> I tried building a snowman once.  
> But my fingers froze.  
> It wasn't the first time I felt that way.
> I really am not a depressed person.
> As fashionable as it may be.  
> I just felt something tonight.  
> I'm sure you know what I am talking about.  
> The pianist between my ears is playing tremendously well.  
> It's hitting harder than Minecraft music.  
> The problem is just that I can't tell if I am in creative mode or if this is me trying to survive.  
> But the moon, she was very pretty tonight.
