The moon was pretty tonight.
Yet I still felt so conflicted. 
I want to understand the beautiful.
But on the other hand, I want to feel the beautiful. 
The search for intellectual clarity seems to prevent it.
Perhaps feeling it is maximal knowledge of it. 
I don't know anymore.

Sleep feels blissful. 
Non-existence feels good right now. 
Am I sad? 
I don't know what I am tired from. 
Do you ever just feel like laying down on the concrete?
Perhaps I am tired of being the only one to witness myself.
It is just that same, stupid, simple feeling--
You know when you keep driving and driving...
the AC stops working and you end up melting into the seat.
It no longer feels like there is a passenger on this journey.

My desire to understand is ultimately a desire to be understood.
Please, I don't want to sleep tonight.
My insides are churning.
Not sure if it is the Taco Bell or the existential dread.
I guess depth is what we are all looking for.
That is why we make up goals and follow recipes.

Why does my heart want to sink?
Perhaps it is tired of people telling it what it should be doing.
Heard too many definitions of love.
How can something that is so haphazardly over-defined actually mean anything true at all?
A distant and fading memory at this point.

You know, I do try to remember things.
But I don't think I ate enough okra when love was still real.
My tears are stuck behind my skull.
I ask it to come out, but it seems like my knocks aren't getting through.
If only I had a Ring camera for my consciousness.

I tried building a snowman once.
My fingers froze though.
But it wasn't the first time I felt that way.

Really, I am not a depressing person.
I just want to feel something tonight.
I am sure you know that feeling.
The pianist between my ears is playing well tonight.
It's hitting harder than Minecraft music.
It's just that I can't tell if I am in creative mode or if I am just trying to survive.

The moon was pretty tonight.
